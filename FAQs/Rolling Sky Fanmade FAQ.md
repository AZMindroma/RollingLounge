**How to download Rolling Sky Edit?**
There is not ONE Rolling Sky Edit download link. Rolling Sky Edit is a broad term which defines all levels made by the community using the modification of Rolling Sky's original code. 
Officially, Rolling Lounge only distributes certain fanmades which include Rolling Sky Edits, such as **Rolling Fanmade, Rolling Universe, Rolling Unlimited and Rolling World.** 

**Why is Rolling Fanmade/Rolling Unlimited/Rolling World not opening?**
Rolling Fanmade, Rolling Unlimited and Rolling World have a **timebomb**, a feature that only allows the game to be played in certain dates (in order to encrypt the game). If you wish to continue playing any of these games __after their timebomb expires__, you must **change the date of your device.** You may find the appropiate dates to change your device version to in #fanmade-downloads.
