**How to download Rolling Sky Edit?**
There is not ONE Rolling Sky Edit download link. Rolling Sky Edit is a broad term which defines all levels made by the community using the modification of Rolling Sky's original code. 
Officially, Rolling Lounge only distributes certain fanmades which include Rolling Sky Edits, such as **Rolling Fanmade, Rolling Universe, Rolling Unlimited and Rolling World.** 

**Why is Rolling Fanmade/Rolling Unlimited/Rolling World not opening?**
Rolling Fanmade, Rolling Unlimited and Rolling World have a **timebomb**, a feature that only allows the game to be played in certain dates (in order to encrypt the game). If you wish to continue playing any of these games __after their timebomb expires__, you must **change the date of your device.** You may find the appropiate dates to change your device version to in #fanmade-downloads.

**How can I make edits myself?**
Sadly, we cannot make resources for editing too accessible. We had a #rs-assets channel before with resources for editing RS, which resulted in a huge scandal. To get help with starting out in editing, there are some resources in the pinned messages of #rolling-sky-chat. If the resources aren't enough for you, you can ask people, but if they don't know how to edit or don't want to tell you, don't pressure them further. Generally, it's a difficult topic and we much rather recommend fanmades like **Rolling Sky Remake** to make levels easily.

**I can't change to Portrait Mode in Rolling Sky Remake 1.0!**
The versions of Rolling Sky Remake (on Android) from 1.0r and later do not support portrait mode since the game was designed as a widescreen-only game. 
This means it not changing to portrait is intended behavior and will stay that way. To play RSR in portrait mode, you may install a Screen Orientation app from the Play Store to force RSR to go to portrait mode. This however was reported to make the sensitivity of the ball weird.

**I'm on iOS! What fanmades can I play? Everything just seems to be available on Android.**
Since making apps for iOS with Unity requires Xcode (requires a macOS device) or Unity Build Automation (not free) and a lack of testing opportunities, not every fanmade can afford making iOS builds. There are some iOS builds available though

**I want to play/need help with Rolling Time/Sphere/Zealous/Renaissance!**
We cannot provide official support for those fanmades since we are not partnered with their respective owners. You may ask people for help, but
