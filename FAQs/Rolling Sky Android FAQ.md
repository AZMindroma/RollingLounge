**I can't find Rolling Sky on the Google Play Store!**
Cheetah Mobile, the mother company formally owning Rolling Sky, has been banned in 2020 due to them performing ad fraud on some of their apps. Ad Fraud means CM was scamming ad providers to gain extra revenue that they didn't deserve. Therefore, Google has banned Cheetah Mobile and their games; There had been attempts to republish it under a different company name, which however didn't work.

We provided APKs (Android Package Kits) in this server which you can use to continue playing Rolling Sky on Android. The newest APKs are provided in #rs-news, usually, not soon after in #downloads as well.   

**What is the difference between the "Chinese TapTap" and "International TapTap" version?**
Due to RS' ban from Google Play, the primary source for RS APK's is TapTap, a game store.
__The Chinese TapTap version:__
- Has an extra verification system due to video game laws in China, only allowing children to play at certain times. 
- Shares the same directory as the Google Play version, meaning Google Play versions can be updated to Chinese TapTap versions
- Shows Chinese ads which for some only show up partially, and for some don't show up at all. 
__The International TapTap version:__
- Lacks verification
- Ads fully work
- Does not share the same directory as the Google Play version, meaning progress is not synced between Google Play/Chinese TapTap and this version
Both versions can be installed at the same time on your Android device.

**I can't buy anything on Android!**
Unfortunately, due to RS' ban from Google Play Store, it's not possible to buy anything using the Google Play version anymore. The TapTap stores don't work, so it's not possible to buy anything with them either. There isn't any known way to buy anything in Rolling Sky on Android anymore.
