**What is this server about?**
Rolling Lounge is a **community server** which most notably is about the mobile game **Rolling Sky** and its various fanmades. What this means is that the server is not explicitly about Rolling Sky and we customize the server depending on what the community of this server is interested in.

**Why does this server have so many channels?**
Due to the variety of topics and the amount of purpose that the server has, in addition with the server's early foundation (before forums and threads existed), the channel list has heavily grown over time. We are working on reducing this in a smart way as time goes on.

**You talk about many channels, I barely see any!**
You might have skipped the onboarding questions in <id:customize> which assign channels depending on your interests. If you wish on seeing all channels in the server (we have many), you may check "Show All Channels" in the server settings.

**Who is the owner of this server?**
Formally, **SHAvibe** has ownership rights over the server. However, since he is busy, he does not carry owner responsibilities. Instead, the administration team takes those responsibilities. This means that there isn't one definitive owner.

**Where can I report server members?**
You may ping a moderator who is currently online. If there are none, you may also ping Administrators and Head Staffs and in emergencies, you may also ping a Server/Event Manager. If you don't want to report visible to everyone else, you may also send a direct message to @ModMail#5460 to contact all staff members.

**How do I level up?**
You get between 15 and 25 XP per minute when you type messages in the server. As such, spamming is useless. Higher levels take more XP to reach.

**How do I become a staff member for this server?**
At certain times, staff applications are opened in which you can apply to become a staff member. If the applications are open, you will see a channel named staff-applications in the Server Core category with links and information. 

**How do I put suggestions into #suggestions?**
You may suggest anything regarding the server (not Rolling Sky, fanmades etc.) by typing ?suggest, following with your suggestion in #bot-cmds. Your suggestion will then appear in #suggestions.
